### Overview

#### Fixed animation timeline off by 1 frame
Fixed a bug where the first frame of a video is used twice (i.e., the 99th frame is presented as the 100th frame). All previously created profiles are all off by one frame, which will be fixed once imported using the new version of FCS. However, it also means that it will be incorrect if the fixed profile is imported back to a previous version of FCS. Therefore, once imported to the new version, it is not possible to downgrade to use the previous version.
